Reiki Level Two - Lesson One: Introduction to the Second Degree
Reflecting on Your Reiki Journey
Reiki Level One is just the beginning of a profound journey—one filled with self-discovery, growth, and a deeper connection to the universal energy. It introduces you to a new way of experiencing life, shifting your perspective and opening doors to possibilities you may never have considered before.

Reiki is pure energy—unlimited, ever-present, and deeply transformative. It connects us to an unconditional love that is always available to those willing to receive it. Words alone can’t fully describe Reiki; it’s something that must be experienced firsthand. Each person’s experience with Reiki is unique, making it difficult to define in exact terms. Whether you’ve received Reiki from a practitioner or gone through Level One training yourself, the energy has the potential to create lasting, positive changes in your life—if you’re open to it.

The Path to Reiki Level Two
Reiki Level Two is the next major step in deepening your understanding and attunement to this powerful energy. To reach this stage, you must have completed Reiki Level One, whether through a workshop or home study, and received the first-degree attunements. At this point, you should already have a foundational knowledge of Reiki and some hands-on experience working with the energy.

Unlike beginners who may have approached Reiki with skepticism, Level Two students typically have developed more confidence in the practice. They have firsthand experience of Reiki’s power and are eager to expand their abilities. It’s common for practitioners to take time after their Level One training to fully integrate its teachings into their daily lives. This helps build a strong foundation before advancing to the next stage.

If you feel a strong pull toward Level Two, it’s usually a sign that the time is right. Many practitioners are guided by an inner calling or a life event that signals they’re ready to progress. The most important factor in deciding to move forward is your own readiness and desire to deepen your Reiki practice.

Understanding Reiki Level Two
Trying to explain exactly how Reiki works is nearly impossible—at least in a way that satisfies logic or science. The universal life force energy operates beyond human understanding, much like many aspects of the world around us.

Think about it—most people can’t fully explain how electricity, the internet, or even a microwave works, yet they use these things daily. Just because we can’t define something in technical terms doesn’t mean we can’t experience its benefits. The same applies to Reiki. You don’t have to fully understand how it works to use it effectively. What matters is your willingness to trust the process and embrace the deeper connection Reiki offers.

Reiki Level Two takes you beyond hands-on healing and introduces new techniques that will allow you to expand your practice. As you continue this journey, you’ll learn to work with Reiki in more advanced ways, strengthening your connection to this powerful energy and enhancing your ability to help yourself and others.

 **The Intelligence of Reiki and the Universal Connection**  

As you study, practice, and experience the teachings of Reiki Level Two, you’ll develop your own understanding of how this energy works. While logical explanations can help, the simplest and most effective approach is to trust in Reiki’s infinite wisdom—letting go of doubt and fear.  

For those seeking a deeper insight into Reiki Level Two, here’s an attempt to explain it from a broader perspective.  

Reiki is **omnipresent**—existing everywhere at all times. It is **omnipotent**—holding unlimited power. It is **omniscient**—possessing infinite wisdom and knowledge. This universal life force connects all living beings, much like the way every drop of water is part of the vast ocean. Though we may see ourselves as individual droplets, we are still connected to the whole, constantly interacting and communicating on an unconscious level.  

69
The same concept applies within the human body. Every cell has its own unique function and responsibility, yet it remains deeply interconnected with the body’s other 50 trillion cells. There is an ongoing, unseen communication between them that allows the body to function as a whole.  

This idea of an interconnected universe isn’t just spiritual—it has been explored in science as well. Deepak Chopra, in *Quantum Healing*, describes how subatomic particles, even when separated by vast distances, still react to each other. When an electron jumps to a different orbit within an atom, its paired positron must react accordingly—no matter where it exists in the universe. This suggests an underlying intelligence in the fabric of reality itself.  

A fascinating real-world example of this kind of connection comes from a study of monkey behavior. Scientists observed that a monkey on the coast of Japan began dipping its sweet potatoes in salt water before eating them. Soon after, the entire colony adopted this behavior. Initially, researchers assumed the monkeys were copying each other. 

However, they later discovered that monkeys in completely different parts of the world, with no physical connection to the original colony, had also started dipping their sweet potatoes in salt water. This unexplained form of communication was referred to as "morphic resonance."

Nature itself demonstrates this kind of intelligent energy exchange. In another study, scientists observed that when giraffes began overgrazing on certain trees, the trees responded by increasing the amount of tannin in their leaves, making them too bitter to eat. The trees weren’t just reacting individually they were communicating with each other through gases and energy, triggering a collective defense response.  

Reiki operates in a similar way. It is an energy with intelligence, capable of connecting and communicating beyond time and space. By tapping into Reiki, we align ourselves with this universal wisdom, allowing it to flow through us for healing, transformation, and deeper understanding.

 **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Two: Gassho**  

# **The First Pillar of Reiki**  
In Reiki Level One, you were introduced to the five Reiki principles, which are rooted in the three foundational pillars of Reiki: **Gassho, Reiji-Ho, and Chiryo**. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the first pillar—**Gassho**.  

# **What is Gassho?**  
Gassho means **"two hands coming together."** It is a simple yet powerful gesture where the hands are placed together in a prayer-like position. In Buddhist practice, this gesture is known as a **mudra**, symbolizing unity, gratitude, and respect.  

Gassho is more than just a hand position—it’s a way to **center yourself, calm the mind, and connect with the energy of Reiki**. It represents harmony, balance, and the recognition that all beings are interconnected.  


 111



# **Forms of Traditional Gassho**  
There are two primary forms of Gassho used in Reiki practice:  

1. **Formal Gassho** – This is used in rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual practices. The hands are pressed together in front of the face, with fingers straight and aligned. The forearms are held at about a **30-degree angle to the floor**, and the fingertips are positioned at the level of the nose. The hands should be about a fist’s distance in front of the tip of the nose, with the eyes focused on the middle fingertips. This position helps cultivate a **reverent and mindful state**.  

2. **Mushin Gassho** – Used in greetings and informal practice, this form is slightly more relaxed. The hands are brought together **loosely**, with the fingertips touching but leaving a small space between the palms. The forearms are at about a **45-degree angle to the floor**, with the hands positioned either in front of the mouth or just above the heart. This version embodies **openness and humility**.  
xxx
# **Other Variations of Gassho**  
Different Buddhist traditions incorporate variations of Gassho, each with its own significance:  

- **Lotus Gassho** – Similar to Mushin Gassho but with fingers slightly curved and the **middle fingertips about an inch apart**. This form is mainly used by **priests in ceremonies**.  
- **Diamond Gassho** – Similar to Mushin Gassho but with **fingers interlocked and straight**. This version is used in **special rituals** by priests.  

# **Gassho Meditation: A Daily Practice**  
In traditional Reiki training, **Gassho meditation** was practiced at the start of every workshop and meeting. **Dr. Usui instructed his students to practice this meditation every morning and evening for five to twenty minutes**.  

This meditation is simple yet powerful, helping to cultivate **focus, clarity, and relaxation**. If you find it beneficial, commit to practicing it daily for at least **30 days**. Keeping a journal of your experiences can help track changes and insights that arise from regular practice.  

# **How to Practice Gassho Meditation**  
1. **Set aside 5–20 minutes** each day for meditation. Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and bring your hands together in Gassho at the center of your chest.  
2. **Focus your attention on the meeting point of your two middle fingers**. This focus helps quiet the mind and bring awareness to the present moment.  
3. **If thoughts arise, acknowledge them, let them go, and return to focusing on your fingertips**.  
4. **Repeat the five Reiki principles** either silently or aloud.  
5. **If your hands become uncomfortable**, allow them to rest lightly together on your lap while maintaining focus.  
6. **You may feel sensations such as warmth, coolness, or even see visual images**—these are natural. Observe them, then return your focus to the middle fingertips.  
7. **Maintain good posture**—a straight spine is ideal, but if needed, use a supportive chair or sit against a wall. If meditating while lying down, be mindful to stay awake, especially in morning sessions.  


Here’s your rewritten version of **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Three: Reiji-Ho** in your tone, keeping it clear, structured, and easy to follow:

 **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Three: Reiji-Ho**  

# **The Second Pillar of Reiki**  
Reiji-Ho is the second pillar of Reiki, meaning **"indication of the Reiki power."** In this term, **"Reiji"** refers to an indication or sign, while **"Ho"** means method. Reiji-Ho consists of **three simple but powerful steps** performed before each Reiki treatment to ensure a strong connection to the energy and intuitive guidance throughout the session.  

 **Step One: Connecting to Reiki**  
Before beginning any Reiki treatment, take a moment to connect to the universal life force:  

1. Place your hands together in **Gassho** (prayer position) in front of your chest and close your eyes.  
2. **Invite Reiki to flow through you**—this can be as simple as mentally or verbally asking it to activate.  
3. Within moments, you may begin to **feel the Reiki energy flowing through you**. It may enter through your **crown chakra, heart chakra, or hands**.  
4. If you are attuned to **second-degree Reiki or are a Reiki master**, you may choose to activate the **distant healing symbol** to strengthen your connection.  
5. **Silently repeat your intention three times** for Reiki to flow, then seal it with the **power symbol** for added focus and strength.  
6. Once you clearly feel the energy flowing, move on to the next step.  

 **Step Two: Praying for the Recipient's Healing**  
After establishing your connection to Reiki, shift your focus toward the person receiving the healing:  

1. Offer a **prayer or intention** for their healing, asking for their highest good on all levels—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.  
2. Trust Reiki to **work where it’s needed**, without forcing or controlling the outcome.  
3. Keeping your hands in Gassho, **raise them in front of your third eye** (the center of your forehead) and ask Reiki to **guide your hands** to where the energy is most needed.  

 **Step Three: Using Intuition**  
This final step allows Reiki to take over and guide the healing session:  

1. **Allow your hands to be drawn naturally** to the areas that need healing. Reiki acts like a magnet, leading your hands where they are most needed.  
2. **Trust your intuition**—this process may feel easy or challenging at first, but with practice, it will become second nature.  
3. Let go of **any expectations** about the outcome. Reiki knows where to go, and your role is to allow it to flow.  
4. Some practitioners experience **a pull or warmth** in certain areas, while others may receive **mental images, inner knowing, or even auditory guidance** about where Reiki should be directed.  
5. If you don’t feel immediate guidance, **don’t force it or worry**—intuition strengthens with practice. The more you trust, the clearer it becomes.  
6. **Reiki will naturally guide your hands**—as energy is received, it will begin to taper off, signaling when it's time to move to a different area.  
7. Once all areas that require Reiki have been treated, your hands will **naturally come to rest**, and the session will feel complete.  

At the end of the session, return to the **Gassho position** once more to conclude Reiji-Ho.  

 **Reiji-Ho in Summary:**  
1. **Hands in Gassho** – Connect to Reiki.  
2. **Set your intention or prayer** for the recipient’s healing.  
3. **Raise hands to the third eye** – Ask Reiki to guide you.  
4. **Let intuition lead** – Follow the energy to where it’s needed.  

By practicing Reiji-Ho before each Reiki session, you create a **stronger, more intuitive, and deeply connected healing experience** for both yourself and those you work with.  

Here’s your rewritten version of **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Four: Chiryo**, keeping it **clear, structured, and easy to follow** while maintaining all key details:  

---

 **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Four: Chiryo**  

# **The Third Pillar of Reiki**  
Chiryo translates to **"treatment"** and represents the practical application of Reiki healing.  

1. To begin a Reiki treatment, place your **dominant hand above the client’s crown chakra** and wait for an intuitive impulse or sensation.  
2. Throughout the session, **allow your intuition to guide your hands**, moving them freely based on where energy is needed.  
3. Your hands will naturally be drawn to areas experiencing pain or discomfort. Keep them there until the **pain eases** or your hands feel naturally guided to another spot.  

 **The Role of Breath in Reiki**  
Breath is the link between the **body, mind, and spirit**. In many spiritual and healing traditions, breath is considered a **powerful tool for vitality and energy flow**. Just as oxygen nourishes the physical body, the act of breathing also draws in **universal life force energy**, purifying and strengthening the practitioner.  

Dr. Usui taught a **breathing technique called Joshin Kokyu-Ho**, which means **"breathing to cleanse the spirit."** This method enhances the flow of Reiki energy, allowing you to become a **clear and open channel** for healing.  

---

 **How to Practice Joshin Kokyu-Ho (Cleansing Breath Technique)**  

# **1. Prepare Your Body and Mind**  
- Sit comfortably with your spine straight and **relax your body**.  
- Close your eyes and take a moment to settle into stillness.  

# **2. Inhale Reiki Energy Through the Crown Chakra**  
- Slowly **inhale through your nose**, visualizing Reiki energy entering through your **crown chakra** at the top of your head.  
- Become aware of the energy **flowing into you** as you breathe in deeply and calmly.  

# **3. Direct the Energy to the Tanden**  
- Draw your breath **deep into your lower abdomen**, just below the navel.  
- This area, known as the **Tanden (Japanese) or Dantian (Chinese traditions)**, is the body’s **center of vitality and life force storage**.  
- Allow the energy to **gather and settle in this core energy center**.  

# **4. Hold and Absorb the Energy**  
- Hold the breath for a few seconds, letting the Reiki energy **nourish and revitalize your entire being**.  
- Imagine the energy expanding within you, **strengthening your physical, emotional, and spiritual body**.  

# **5. Exhale Reiki Energy**  
- **Slowly exhale through your mouth**, releasing any tension or negativity.  
- As you breathe out, visualize Reiki energy flowing **not only from your mouth** but also from your **hands, feet, and the chakras in your palms and soles**.  
- This energy radiates outward, **clearing blockages** and creating a powerful cycle of healing.  

# **6. The Continuous Flow of Energy**  
- Reiki energy **enters from the universe** and cycles through you, **recharging and renewing** you with each breath.  
- This process strengthens your ability to **channel Reiki freely and effectively** during healing sessions.  

---

 **Additional Breathing Technique from Tai Chi**  
In **Tai Chi and other Eastern practices**, it is recommended to:  
- **Inhale with the tongue resting on the roof of your mouth** (touching the front teeth).  
- **Exhale while relaxing the tongue** on the bottom of your mouth.  

This simple adjustment enhances energy flow and can be incorporated into your Reiki practice for **greater effectiveness and balance**.  

---

By practicing **Joshin Kokyu-Ho** regularly, you will refine your ability to **harness and direct Reiki energy**, making your treatments more powerful and effective. Try incorporating this breathwork into your self-healing routine and when working with clients to experience its full benefits.  

Here’s your rewritten version of **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Five: Namaste**, keeping it **clear, structured, and easy to follow** while maintaining all key details:

---

 **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Five: Namaste**  

# **The Meaning of Namaste**  
Namaste is a **spiritual greeting** that acknowledges the divine essence within each person. It is a recognition of the sacred connection shared between all beings.  

*"I honor the place in you in which the entire universe dwells.  
I honor the place in you which is of love, truth, light, and peace.  
When you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, we are one."*  

This **simple yet powerful gesture**, also known as a **mudra**, is performed by:  
- Bringing **both palms together** at the heart center.  
- **Lightly bowing the head** in a gesture of respect.  

Namaste represents **humility, reverence, and a deep acknowledgment** of another’s divine nature.  

---

 **The Etymology of Namaste**  
The word **Namaste** comes from **Sanskrit**, combining two parts:  
- **Nama** – meaning *to bow, bend, or incline*.  
- **Te** – meaning *you*.  

Together, **Namaste** translates to *"I bow to you in respect."*  

Breaking it down further:  
- **Na** – meaning *not or negation*.  
- **Ma** – meaning *mine*.  

This suggests **"not mine"**, symbolizing the **dissolution of ego** and the understanding that our soul is not separate, but part of the universal whole.  

Some interpretations suggest that **“Ma”** in Namaste also represents **death**, and when combined with **"Na"**, it negates death—symbolizing **immortality** and the eternal nature of the soul.  

---

 **Namaste on Three Levels**  

1. **Mental Submission**  
   - Namaste represents **complete surrender** of the self, much like **Bhakti (devotion)** in spiritual traditions.  
   - It is a recognition that by honoring another’s divinity, we also cultivate those same qualities within ourselves.  

2. **Physical Expression**  
   - Namaste is more than just a greeting—it serves as a **reminder of the sacredness within each person**.  
   - When we bow in recognition of another’s divine nature, we also **awaken that same divine essence within ourselves**.  

3. **Verbal Acknowledgment**  
   - Saying “Namaste” is a form of spoken **reverence and respect**, recognizing the inherent sacredness in all people, regardless of status or background.  

---

 **The Symbolism Behind the Namaste Gesture**  

1. **Hand Positioning**  
   - The **five fingers of the left hand** represent the **five senses of action (Karma)**.  
   - The **five fingers of the right hand** represent the **five organs of knowledge**.  
   - Bringing them together symbolizes the **harmony between wisdom and action**.  

2. **Merging Opposites into Unity**  
   - Namaste is a **symbol of balance and unity**, integrating dualities such as:  
     - **Masculine & Feminine**  
     - **Heaven & Earth**  
     - **Sun & Moon**  
     - **Mind & Body**  
     - **Conscious & Unconscious**  
     - **Pleasure & Pain**  
     - **Astral & Physical Body**  

Through Namaste, these opposing forces are brought into harmony, allowing for **greater spiritual awareness and transformation**.  

---

 **Namaste as a Social Greeting**  
Beyond its spiritual meaning, Namaste is also used as a **universal greeting of respect and connection**. When two people exchange Namaste, it serves as:  
- Acknowledgment of the divine within each other.  
- A way to express **happiness and appreciation** upon meeting.  
- A method to **set a positive and peaceful tone** for an interaction.  

Unlike a handshake, which focuses on **physical connection**, Namaste transcends the material world and acknowledges a **deeper, energetic connection**.  

Namaste is:  
- **A universal equalizer** – It can be used with **anyone**, regardless of status or title.  
- **A sign of deep respect** – Unlike a handshake, Namaste can be exchanged between a teacher and student, or even a leader and an entire audience, without diminishing its meaning.  

---

 **The Spiritual & Energetic Power of Namaste**  
While some believe Namaste originated as a way to show **peaceful intentions**, much like a handshake, it holds **far deeper significance**:  

- In **Yoga** and **Buddhism**, Namaste (also known as the **Anjali Mudra**) is used in **meditation, prayer, and devotion**.  
- It is believed that **the vibration of the word "Namaste"** carries spiritual energy, aligning the speaker with **higher frequencies of peace and unity**.  
- According to Eastern traditions, spiritual practice is shaped by three key elements:  
  1. **Mudras (hand gestures)**  
  2. **Mantras (sacred sounds and chants)**  
  3. **Mind (focused intention and consciousness)**  

Since **Namaste incorporates all three**, it is considered a **form of meditation in itself**, acting as a silent **prayer of unity and reverence**.  

By using Namaste, we embrace the **truth that we are all connected**—beyond race, culture, and belief—sharing in the same divine light.  

Here’s your rewritten version of **Reiki Level Two - Lessons Six, Seven, and Eight**, keeping it **structured, clear, and easy to follow** while ensuring all key details are included:

---

# **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Six: New Possibilities with Reiki 2**  

 **Expanding Your Reiki Potential**  
After receiving the **Reiki 2 attunement**, practitioners gain access to **sacred Reiki symbols**—powerful tools that unlock **deeper levels of healing and energy work**. With this initiation, Reiki energy becomes stronger, more focused, and more versatile.  

 **Three Major Advancements in Reiki 2**  

1. **Enhanced Energy Flow & Healing Power**  
   - Reiki 2 amplifies and **refines the flow of universal life force energy**, making treatments more effective.  
   - Practitioners can **channel stronger energy**, allowing for **deeper healing on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels**.  

2. **More Efficient Treatments**  
   - A Reiki 2 practitioner can complete a full session in as little as **15 minutes**, whereas Reiki 1 may take up to **90 minutes**.  
   - This efficiency allows for **helping more people in less time** while maintaining the same healing impact.  

3. **Distant Healing Across Time & Space**  
   - Reiki symbols unlock the ability to **send healing energy remotely**—to a person, location, event, or even to past or future situations.  
   - This enables practitioners to assist those who are far away, providing healing beyond physical boundaries.  

---

 **The Power of Reiki 2 Symbols**  
- **Reiki symbols act as keys**, unlocking new dimensions of healing and energy manipulation.  
- As you integrate these symbols into your practice, you will discover **endless applications** based on your creativity and understanding.  

# **Energetic & Spiritual Growth After Attunement**  
- A Reiki 2 practitioner’s **personal vibrational frequency** increases up to **four times** higher than Reiki 1.  
- Many practitioners experience **enhanced intuition and psychic abilities**, improving by **80%–100%**.  
- As with any attunement, this level initiates a **21-day detoxification period**, helping the body, mind, and spirit adjust to the new energy.  

---

# **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Seven: The Sacred Reiki Symbols**  

 **Understanding the Role of Symbols in Reiki**  
Reiki **symbols** are among the most **sacred and powerful** tools in energy healing. In Reiki 2, these symbols help practitioners:  
- **Deepen their connection** to universal life force energy.  
- **Expand their healing capabilities** beyond Reiki 1.  
- **Increase the effectiveness** of both self-healing and treatments for others.  

While Reiki 1 practitioners can still access universal energy, the **use of symbols magnifies and refines** its flow, allowing for **greater control, focus, and potency**.  

---

 **What Comes Next?**  
As we move into **symbol mastery**, we will explore:  
- **The meanings and uses** of each Reiki symbol.  
- **Techniques for activating and integrating symbols** in healing sessions.  
- **How symbols enhance distant healing, emotional healing, and spiritual growth**.  

By learning to work with Reiki symbols, practitioners gain **a deeper level of mastery over energy flow**, expanding their ability to heal and transform lives.  

---

# **Reiki Level Two - Lesson Eight: The First Sacred Symbol - Cho Ku Rei**  

 **Introduction to the First Sacred Symbol**  
The **Cho Ku Rei** symbol is one of the **most fundamental and powerful symbols** in Reiki. It is often referred to as:  
- **The Power Symbol**  
- **The Activator**  
- **The Light Switch** – because it **"turns on" Reiki energy** and amplifies all other symbols.  

---

 **Etymology & Meaning**  
The name **Cho Ku Rei** consists of three Japanese kanji:
